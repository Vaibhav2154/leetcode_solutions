# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Python, organized by problem categories.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into the following categories:

```
leetcode_solutions/
├── hashing/          # Hash table and hash map problems
├── math/             # Mathematical problems
├── sliding_window/   # Sliding window technique problems
└── trees/            # Tree data structure problems
```

## 📋 Problems by Category

### Hashing
- **Problem 1** - Two Sum ([Solution](hashing/1.py))
- **Problem 219** - Contains Duplicate II ([Solution](hashing/219.py))
- **Problem 3719** ([Solution](hashing/3719.py))

### Math
- **Problem 7** - Reverse Integer ([Solution](math/7.py))

### Sliding Window
- **Problem 3** - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters ([Solution](sliding_window/3.py))
- **Problem 219** - Contains Duplicate II ([Solution](sliding_window/219.py))

### Trees
- **Problem 110** - Balanced Binary Tree ([Solution](trees/110.py))
- **Problem 1382** - Balance a Binary Search Tree ([Solution](trees/1382.py))

## 🚀 Usage

Each solution file contains a `Solution` class with the main method(s) to solve the problem. To use any solution:

```python
from hashing.1 import Solution

# Example: Two Sum
solution = Solution()
result = solution.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```
